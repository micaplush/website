description: I made some 88x31-sized animated buttons and you can use them!
---

I've finally gotten around to making some buttons for my site in the classic 88
by 31 size. If you don't know what that is, these used to be common on personal
sites in the 90's and they're becoming popular again.

It's cute so I made two. :3

You can use them to link to my site and you can also send me yours so I can link
to your site (if I feel like it).

BTW, if you plan on embedding one of these buttons on your site, consider
copying the alt text I've written!

## Nonbinary antifa

<p style="text-align: center">
{{< 88x31 "nonbinary-antifa" >}}
</p>

### Fonts used

- "Aseprite" by the Aseprite developers
- "Aseprite Mini" by the Aseprite developers
- ["Awake"](https://3d.itch.io/fonts) by 3d

### Tools used

- Aseprite
- GIMP
- Inkscape (for recoloring an SVG of the antifa logo)
- [GenerativePixelFire](https://github.com/Astropulse/GenerativePixelFire)
  Processing script by Astropulse for generating the fire animation

**Feel free to use this one for yourself if you want. :3**

If you wanna use it to link back to my site and you also want something to
disambiguate it from your own usage of the button (or someone else's), you can
use this version which mentions my site. I don't demand attribution though, you
can also just use the previous version!

<p style="text-align: center">
{{< 88x31 "nonbinary-antifa-attribution" >}}
</p>

## Mica now!

If you don't wanna use the previous button to link back to me you can also use
this one.

<p style="text-align: center">
{{< 88x31 "mica-now" >}}
</p>

### Fonts used

- "Aseprite" by the Aseprite developers
- The general design is taken from an
  ["ASEXUALS NOW!" button](https://88x31.nl/gifs/asexuals_now.gif) I found but I
  don't know who made it

### Tools used

- Aseprite
